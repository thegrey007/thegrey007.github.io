Hi! I am Shreya S Ramanujam, an incoming first-year MS EE student at Stanford. Previously, I earned my B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I graduated ranked 2^{nd} in my department and won the American Express Award for the best academic record among all women graduates. My interests lie in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, especially generative models. My B. Tech Thesis under Prof. Andrew Thangaraj was on experimentally and theoretically analyzing model collapse in a wide range of generative models. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
