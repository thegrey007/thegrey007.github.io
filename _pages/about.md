Hi! I'm Shreya, an incoming first-year MS EE student at Stanford. Previously, I earned my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I graduated ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> out of 154 in my department and won the American Express Award for the best academic record among all women graduates. I also earned a Minor in AI/ML. My interests lie in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, especially generative models. My B.Tech Thesis under [Prof. Andrew Thangaraj](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/andrew/) was on experimentally and theoretically analyzing model collapse in a wide range of generative models.

Outside of work, I love reading books (averaging 12 hours on my kindle this vacation!) and solving crosswords. I am also an amateur tennis player, a sport I picked up during my time at IIT Madras and hope to get better at in the coming years.
