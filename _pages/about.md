Hi! I am Shreya S Ramanujam, an incoming first-year MS EE student at Stanford. Previously, I earned my B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I graduated ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> in my department and won the American Express Award for the best academic record among all women graduates. I also earned a Minor in AI/ML. My interests lie in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, especially generative models. My B. Tech Thesis under [Prof. Andrew Thangaraj](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/andrew/) was on experimentally and theoretically analyzing model collapse in a wide range of generative models.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
