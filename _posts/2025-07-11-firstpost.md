I just graduated from IIT Madras! It was a really a bittersweet weekend, and I still cannot believe it's over. Now that I have way too much free time, I have finally started this blog that I have been meaning to for years. Expect book reviews, grad school advice and maybe the occasional ramble about whatever is on my mind. Stay tuned :)
