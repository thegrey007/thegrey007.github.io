<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi! I am Shreya S Ramanujam, an incoming first-year MS EE student at Stanford. Previously, I earned my B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I graduated ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> in my department and won the American Express Award for the best academic record among all women graduates. I also earned a Minor in AI/ML. My interests lie in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, especially generative models. My B. Tech Thesis under <a href="https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/andrew/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Andrew Thangaraj</a> was on experimentally and theoretically analyzing model collapse in a wide range of generative models.</p> <p>Outside of work, I love reading books (averaging 18 hours on my kindle this vacation!) and solving crosswords. I am also an amateur tennis player, a sport I picked up during my time at IIT Madras and hope to get better at in the coming years.</p> </body></html>
